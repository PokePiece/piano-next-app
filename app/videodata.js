It's like something appearing out of thin air that was always there. Chopin clearly isn't writing a song, the song is showing that it's always there.",

Or like one of those sudden reveries that lends you an idea you felt like you always had, when you're left shaking, scared of what it implies. It's like having a very large blue bowling ball pressed on top of you.",
